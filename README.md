# Locomotor Habituation and Pain Mapping

**Currently under development**

Project Overview:
Pain is a salient driver of change in our daily lives. We move differently, avoid activities, and often experience lower quality of life as a result. This project combines several areas, including psychophysics, neuromechanics, and real-time feedback systems to understand how and why we move when experiencing pain.

Through experimental pain delivered using electrical stimulation, I am coupling the perception of pain to real-time movement kinematics measured with IMUs. Other aspects of this project cover psychometric testing of pain perceptions, motor adaptation to pain during walking, and more.
